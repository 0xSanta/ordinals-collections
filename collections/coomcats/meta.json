    "description": "Coomcats is a collection of sub 100k inscriptions. With only 96 rare cats all unique in their own way. These cats were the first collection ever listed on ordswap and hold a special place in the teams heart. Owning a coomcat will grant you a \"creator\" role in the ordswap discord which could be useful for anyone that has or plans to make their own collection. These cats are cool, calm, and collected. No stress, Just vibes. You could say, they are purrrfect \ud83d\ude09",
