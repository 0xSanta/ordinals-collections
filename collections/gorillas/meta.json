    "description": "Ordinal Gorillas distinguish themselves as exceptional digital collectibles, being the first ordinal NFTs that come with utility charges, which makes them attractive to both builders and collectors. As a result, they serve not only as an impressive representation of your web3 identity but also as a valuable and practical addition to your digital wallet. In addition, owning an Ordinal Gorilla gives you access to a range of benefits, including discounted fees on our upcoming marketplace, access to our Inscription service at cost, launchpad for new projects, manifold-style checkout app for Ordinal collections, and much more.",
