    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a gerbil named #TheOrdinalGerbil who had a passion for technology and coding. One day, he discovered NFTs and became obsessed with the concept.\n\nHe spent weeks developing a program that inscribed NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain using ordinals, and his program quickly gained popularity.\n\nPeople from all over the world would send him their digital assets, and he would turn them into NFTs inscribed onto the blockchain using ordinals.\n\nHe became known as the #TheOrdinalGerbil and his reputation grew as more and more people used his program to create unique and cool digital assets.\n\n#TheOrdinalGerbil loved his work and continued to create NFTs inscribed using ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain for many years. He was proud of his contribution to the world of digital assets and knew that he had found his true calling in life.\nBy @NonFunGerbils \nAuthor @Ethstake32",
