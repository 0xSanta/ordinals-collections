  "description": "They are simply breakfast eggs with varied Web 3.0 moods.\nFollowing the recent trend of burning bluechip NFTs on Ethereum\n(ranging from ENS tokens, to the Punks and to even a few Bored Apes)\nand inscribing them on the Bitcoin Ordinal, we asked ourselves the\nquestion:\n  \"Which came first, the chicken or the\n                  egg?\"\nIn the early days of World of Warcraft, one of the most popular video games ever released, the two factions, the Horde and the Alliance, were mortal enemies. As the opposing faction's messages were unreadable to the other, the Horde would mock the Alliance by typing \"LOL\", particularly in PVP matches. This would appear as \"KEK\" to the Alliance.\n\"KEK\" was also used in StarCraft matches. Blizzard is the company\nbehind both StarCraft and World of Warcraft. This term is known by\ngamers of both games. In World of Warcraft, when a Horde player\ntypes \"LOL\" using the /say command, members of the Alliance faction\nsee it as \"KEK\".\nFun fact: Did you know “KEK” is the equivalent to how Koreans express \"haha\" in chat and during online games (ᄏᄏᄏ)?.\nToday, many former gamers continue to use \"KEK\" in the NFT world,\ndemonstrating just how influential gaming culture is in the world of\nNFTs and crypto.\n",
