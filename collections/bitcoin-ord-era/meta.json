    "description": "The objective of the Bitera project is to transfer all valuable ERC721s to the BTC network. To achieve this goal, the project will issue all valuable ERC721 series on the market, but some unexpected issues may arise during the migration to the BTC world, requiring each builder to re-collect and restore these NFTs. Users holding ETH blue-chip NFTs can participate in casting two pieces of the 4th-level fragments of their NFTs. After casting the 4th-level fragments, users can exchange rights or sell by collecting other fragments. Each new NFT can be cast with up to 2 4th-level fragments.",
